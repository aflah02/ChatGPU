# ChatGPU

ChatGPU is an LLM-powered interface for accessing [Modal's GPU Glossary](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/). You can explore it directly [here](https://aflah02--chatgpu-run.modal.run/).

Both the frontend and backend are hosted on Modal. ChatGPU uses Llama 3.1 70B Instruct at the moment.

Special thanks to the Modal team for creating this exceptional resource, making the data available in a structured and easily parsable format, and providing valuable feedback during the prototype development!
